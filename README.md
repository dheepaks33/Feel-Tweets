# FeelTweets

Sentiment analysis of tweets is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in tweets or other text data. It involves analyzing text to understand whether the sentiment behind it is positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis can provide valuable insights into public opinion, brand perception, and trends on social media platforms like Twitter. Here's a description of how sentiment analysis of tweets works:

# Naive Bayes

**Probabilistic Classification**: Naive Bayes is primarily used for classification tasks, where the goal is to assign a label or category to a given input based on its features or attributes.

**Bayes' Theorem**: The algorithm is named after Thomas Bayes and is based on Bayes' theorem, which describes how to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

**Naive Assumption**: The "naive" in Naive Bayes refers to a simplifying assumption that the algorithm makes. It assumes that the features used for classification are conditionally independent, meaning that the presence or absence of one feature does not affect the presence or absence of another. This assumption simplifies the calculation of probabilities.

**Multinomial and Gaussian Variants**: Naive Bayes can be adapted to different types of data. The two most common variants are Multinomial Naive Bayes, which is suitable for discrete data (e.g., text data with word counts), and Gaussian Naive Bayes, which is used for continuous data that follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution.

**Feature Vector**: In classification tasks, the input data is typically represented as a feature vector, where each feature corresponds to a specific attribute or characteristic of the input.

**Probability Calculation**: Naive Bayes calculates the probability of an input belonging to each class or category based on the observed features. It assigns the input to the class with the highest probability.


1. **Data Collection:** The first step in sentiment analysis is to collect a dataset of tweets. This dataset can be gathered using Twitter APIs, web scraping tools, or by using pre-existing datasets. Depending on the research or application, you may collect tweets related to specific topics, hashtags, or from specific users.

2. **Text Preprocessing:** Raw tweet data is often messy and may contain noise in the form of hashtags, mentions, URLs, and special characters. Text preprocessing is essential to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Common preprocessing steps include:
   - Removing punctuation and special characters.
   - Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
   - Removing stop words: Common words like "and," "the," "in" are often removed as they don't carry much sentiment.
   - Lemmatization or stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form.

3. **Sentiment Lexicons:** Sentiment analysis often relies on sentiment lexicons or dictionaries that contain lists of words with associated sentiment scores. Words are categorized as positive, negative, or neutral based on their sentiment. Lexicons can be created manually or obtained from various sources.

4. **Scoring Sentiment:** Each word in a tweet is assigned a sentiment score based on the lexicon. The sentiment scores of individual words are then combined to calculate an overall sentiment score for the tweet. Common methods for scoring include:
   - Counting the number of positive and negative words.
   - Assigning a polarity score (positive or negative) to each word and aggregating these scores.

5. **Sentiment Classification:** The overall sentiment score can be classified into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral. The threshold for classification may vary depending on the application.

6. **Machine Learning Approaches:** Instead of using sentiment lexicons, machine learning models, such as supervised classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models like LSTM or BERT), can be trained on labeled tweet data. These models learn to recognize sentiment patterns in tweets and can achieve high accuracy.

7. **Visualization and Reporting:** The results of sentiment analysis are often visualized using charts or graphs to provide a clear overview of sentiment trends over time or for specific topics. Insights can be reported and shared with stakeholders or used for decision-making.

8. **Real-time Analysis:** Some applications require real-time sentiment analysis to monitor public sentiment as it evolves. Real-time sentiment analysis systems continuously collect and analyze tweets, providing up-to-the-minute insights.

9. **Challenges:** Sentiment analysis of tweets can be challenging due to the informal nature of tweets, use of slang, irony, and context-dependent sentiment. Handling multiple languages and detecting sarcasm or irony can be particularly challenging.

10. **Applications:** Sentiment analysis of tweets has various applications, including brand monitoring, political analysis, customer feedback analysis, and understanding public sentiment during events or crises.
